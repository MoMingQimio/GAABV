## 1. Project Overview
The GA2AD (Generalized Adaptive Adversarial traning framework for Autonomous Driving) is designed to enhance the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in mixed traffic environments by creating adaptive risky scenarios through the adjustment of adversarial maneuvers of Background Vehicles (BVs). This framework combines reinforcement learning (RL)-based and rule-based components, incorporating hybrid risk field-based inverse risk assessment and activation function modules to dynamically adjust the intensity of adversarial actions. The GAABV framework is capable of reducing collision rates by 55-70%, while maintaining operational efficiency with minimal reductions in average speed.

## 3. Installation Guide

### 3.1 Installation Steps
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Install SUMO**: Follow the installation instructions on the [SUMO website](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html).
4. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoMingQimio/GA2AD.git
   cd GAABV
   ```
5. **Run Main Script**: Start training by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### 3.2 Typical Installation Time
The installation process typically takes **10-15 minutes** on a standard desktop computer, depending on your internet connection and system performance.

## 4. Demo
To run the demo, simply execute:
```bash
python main.py
```
The demo will generate an `output.txt` file in the `results/` directory, containing metrics such as collision rate, average speed, and average absolute jerk.

## 5. Instructions for Use
1. Modify the input parameters in `config.py` to match your dataset.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Results will be saved in the `results/` directory.
